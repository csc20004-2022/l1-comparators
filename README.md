# Lecture1: Java Collections and comparisons

Sample code to show the importance of implementing `equals()` and `hashcode()` methods when using Java Collections. \
This code is organised into modules so, to find the relevant java files, you need to navigate under the
`demos` folder to find the usual package structure.

The module contains 3 demo files:

`CollectionDemo.java` \
shows basic operations on data structures from the Java Collections Framework (namely: `ArrayList`)

`TreeSetDemo.java` \
shows how to use a TreeSet in conjunction with your implementation for a `Comparator`

`HashcodeDemo.java` \
shows the effect of implementing a specialised version of `equals()` and `hashcode()`
